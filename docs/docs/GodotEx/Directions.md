# Directions

`Direction2D` and `Direction3D` are arbitrary enum types that define all orthogonal directions in 2D/3D.

```csharp
public enum Direction2D {
    Right, Left, Up, Down
}
```

```csharp
public enum Direction3D {
    Right, Left, Up, Down, Forward, Backward
}
```

Directions are meant to increase code readability since orthogonally defined directions are much more intuitive then vectors or even quaternions.

Let's say you have a free-look camera in your game, occasionally the player may want to set it to look directly forward, down, to the right, etc. You can then create a function for this camera with the help of `Direction3D`:

```csharp
public void LookAt(Direction3D direction) {
    camera.GlobalRotation = direction switch {
        Direction3D.Right => new Vector3(0, -Mathf.Pi / 2, 0);
        Direction3D.Left => new Vector3(0, Mathf.Pi / 2, 0);
        Direction3D.Up => new Vector3(-Mathf.Pi / 2, 0, 0);
        Direction3D.Down => new Vector3(Mathf.Pi / 2, 0, 0);
        Direction3D.Forward => Vector3.Zero;
        Direction3D.Backward => new Vector3(0, Mathf.Pi, 0);
    }
}
```
