# Packed Scene Instantiation

From time to time, you would need to instantiate packed scenes and cast them to a target type in order to use them.

Let's say you have a project structure as follows:

The official way requires a lot of redundant code:

```csharp
var playerScene = GD.Load<PackedScene>("res://Path/To/Player.tscn");
var player = playerScene.Instantiate<Player>();
```

With the `GDx` utilities, you can instantiate packed scenes a lot easier in a few different ways:

1. Providing an explicit scene path with `GDx.New<T>(string path)`
   ```csharp
   var player = GDx.New<Player>("res://Path/To/Player.tscn");
   ```
2. Providing an explicit scene path with the `[ScenePath]` attribute and using `GDx.New<T>()`

   ```csharp
   // Define [ScenePath] in your custom class
   [ScenePath("res://Path/To/Player.tscn")]
   public partial class Player : CharacterBody3D { }

   // Call GDx.New() elsewhere
   var player = GDx.New<Player>()
   ```

3. Defining the `[ScenePath]` attribute with an implicit path and using `GDx.New<T>()`

   ```csharp
   // Define [ScenePath] in your custom class
   [ScenePath]
   public partial class Player : CharacterBody3D { }

   // Call GDx.New() elsewhere
   var player = GDx.New<Player>()
   ```

The third method is the **recommended** way. It uses an implicit file path which discovers the `tscn` file with the name of your custom class located under the folder that holds the `.cs` file defining the class. For this example, the corresponding scene file of the `Player` class should be named as `Player.tscn` and located at `res://Path/To`.
