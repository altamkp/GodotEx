# Asynchronous Extensions

GodotEx asynchronous extensions are a set of asynchronous extension methods for Godot built-in classes such as [SceneTree](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_scenetree.html), [Timer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_timer.html) and [Tween](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_tween.html).They are available through the `GodotEx.Async` package.
